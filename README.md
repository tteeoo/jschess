Chess in javascript

#### This is almost done, I just need to add a few more features:

- Basic move validation for all pieces (being worked on)
- More advanced move validation:
    - En passant
    - Castling
    - Check detection and corresponding rules

Pardon the messy code, I switched IDEs halfway through development and the identation is off a bit.

In the future I plan to remake this in TypeScript, and optimize it a bit.
