Chess in javascript

### Play at: <a href="https://chess.theohenson.com/">chess.theohenson.com</a>

#### This is almost done, I just need to add a few more features:

- En passant
- Castling
- Check detection and corresponding rules

Pardon the messy code, I switched IDEs halfway through development and the identation is off a bit.

In the future I plan to remake this in TypeScript, and optimize it a bit.
