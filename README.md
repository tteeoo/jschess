Chess in javascript

#### This is almost done, I just need to add a few features:

- Basic move verification
- Highlighting valid moves
- Pawn promotion
- More advanced move verification:
    - En passant
    - Castling
    - Not allowing the king to be moved in to checkmate
- Further stylize the web page
